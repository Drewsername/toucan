# Models

## Task Models

### Overview
The task system uses a layered model approach to handle task creation and management:

1. `TaskCreate` - Public model for task creation requests
2. `TaskBase` - Internal model for database representation
3. `Task` - Business logic class

### TaskCreate Model
Used for validating incoming task creation requests:

```python
class TaskCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str
    points: int
    validation_required: bool = False
    random_payout: bool = False
    min_points: Optional[int] = None
    max_points: Optional[int] = None
    due_date: Optional[datetime] = None
```

#### Validation Rules
- Points must be non-negative
- If `random_payout` is True:
  - `min_points` and `max_points` are required
  - Both must be non-negative

### Task Class
Business logic class that handles:
- Task creation and validation
- User pairing checks
- Points calculation and awarding
- Task completion logic

#### Key Methods
- `from_create_request`: Creates a Task from a TaskCreate model
- `save`: Persists task to database with validation
- `complete`: Handles task completion and point awarding
- `get_active_tasks`: Retrieves active tasks for a user

### Example Usage

```python
# Create a task
task_data = TaskCreate(
    title="Clean dishes",
    description="Please clean all dishes",
    points=10
)
task = Task.from_create_request(task_data, creator, assignee)
await task.save()

# Complete a task
task = await Task.get_by_id(task_id, current_user)
await task.complete(current_user)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Always use `TaskCreate` for incoming requests
   - Let Pydantic handle validation
   - Add business logic validation in Task class

2. **Security**
   - Always validate user relationships
   - Check task ownership/assignment
   - Validate points and completion rules

3. **Points System**
   - Handle random payouts carefully
   - Validate point ranges
   - Ensure atomic point updates
