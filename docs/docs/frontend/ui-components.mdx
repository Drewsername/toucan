# UI Components

## HeroUI Integration

The project uses [HeroUI](https://www.heroui.com/) (formerly NextUI) as its primary UI component library. HeroUI provides a set of accessible, customizable, and beautiful components that follow modern design principles.

### Setup

The project has HeroUI configured with the following setup:

1. **Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install @heroui/react @heroui/themes framer-motion
   ```

2. **Tailwind CSS Configuration** (`tailwind.config.js`):
   ```javascript
   const { heroui } = require("@heroui/themes")

   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./index.html",
       "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
       "./node_modules/@heroui/react/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     darkMode: "class",
     plugins: [heroui()],
   }
   ```

3. **Provider Setup** (`App.tsx`):
   ```tsx
   import { HeroUIProvider } from '@heroui/react'

   function App() {
     return (
       <HeroUIProvider>
         {/* Your app content */}
       </HeroUIProvider>
     )
   }
   ```

### Usage

To use HeroUI components in your React components:

1. Import the desired component from @heroui/react:
   ```tsx
   import { Button } from "@heroui/react"
   ```

2. Use the component in your JSX:
   ```tsx
   <Button color="primary">
     Click me
   </Button>
   ```

### Theme Customization

HeroUI themes can be customized through the `tailwind.config.js` file. The default theme is already set up, but you can extend it by modifying the `theme.extend` object in the configuration.

- [HeroUI Themes](https://www.heroui.com/docs/themes)

## Theme Configuration

The application uses HeroUI (formerly NextUI) with a custom theme called "toucan". The theme includes custom color palettes for:
- Primary (red/burgundy)
- Success (green)
- Info (blue)
- Warning (yellow/gold)
- Danger (red)

### Using Theme Colors

Colors can be accessed using Tailwind classes:

```tsx
// Background colors
<div className="bg-primary-500">...</div>
<div className="bg-success-500">...</div>

// Text colors
<div className="text-primary-500">...</div>
<div className="text-danger-500">...</div>
```

### Components

#### TaskCard

The TaskCard component displays task information and provides action buttons for task completion and validation.

```tsx
import { Card, Button } from "@heroui/react";

<TaskCard
  task={taskData}
  isAssignee={true}
  status="active"
/>
```

Props:
- `task`: Task object containing title, description, points, etc.
- `isAssignee`: Boolean indicating if current user is assigned to the task
- `status`: One of 'active' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'

Features:
- Displays task title, points, and description
- Shows due date if present
- Provides Complete button for assignees of active tasks
- Provides Validate button for admins on completed tasks that require validation
- Includes confirmation modal for actions
- Handles loading states and errors

### Dark Mode

The application supports dark mode through HeroUI's theming system. Dark mode classes are automatically applied based on the theme configuration.
