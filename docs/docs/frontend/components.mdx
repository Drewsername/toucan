# Component Library

## Overview
Our frontend utilizes a powerful combination of HeroUI and Tailwind CSS for building beautiful, responsive user interfaces. This setup provides us with a comprehensive set of pre-built components and utility classes while maintaining full customization capabilities.

## Tech Stack

### HeroUI
We use HeroUI as our primary component library. HeroUI provides a set of fully accessible, customizable components that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

#### Installation
Our project comes with HeroUI pre-installed. If you need to install it in a new project:

```bash
npm install @heroui/react
```

#### Usage
Import components from HeroUI:

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from '@heroui/react'
```

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is our utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development.

#### Configuration
Tailwind is configured in two main files:
- `frontend/tailwind.config.js`: Main configuration file
- `frontend/postcss.config.js`: PostCSS configuration for Tailwind

#### Usage
Tailwind classes can be used directly in your JSX:

```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
  <h1 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Example Component</h1>
</div>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Component Consistency**
   - Use HeroUI components when available instead of building from scratch
   - Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
   - Follow the established color palette defined in `tailwind.config.js`

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.)
   - Test components across different screen sizes

3. **Performance**
   - Import HeroUI components individually to enable tree-shaking
   - Use `@apply` directives sparingly and prefer inline Tailwind classes

## Theme Customization
Our theme extends both HeroUI and Tailwind's default theme. Refer to `tailwind.config.js` for custom colors, spacing, and other design tokens.

## Examples

### TaskCard
The TaskCard component is a key UI element that displays task information using HeroUI's Card component and includes a value-over-time chart.

```tsx
import { TaskCard } from '../components/TaskCard';

// Example usage
<TaskCard
  task={taskData}
  isAssignee={true}
  status="active"
/>
```

#### Features
- Beautiful HeroUI Card design with status-based styling
- Points visualization with Recharts area chart
- Dropdown menu for task actions
- Status-based color schemes
- Icon indicators for validation requirements
- Due date display with icon
- Responsive layout

#### Props
- `task`: Task object containing all task details
- `isAssignee`: Boolean indicating if current user is the task assignee
- `status`: Task status ('active' | 'completed' | 'cancelled')

#### Styling
The component uses HeroUI's `tv` (tailwind variants) for consistent styling:
- Status-based color schemes (primary for active, success for completed, danger for cancelled)
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Responsive chart display
- Icon integration with status indicators
