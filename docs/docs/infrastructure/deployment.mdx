# Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers our Railway-based deployment process, including common issues and their solutions.

## Backend Deployment Requirements

### Required Files

1. **Procfile** (in `/backend`):
```bash
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```
This file is crucial for Railway to know how to start the FastAPI application. The settings ensure:
- Uses uvicorn as the ASGI server
- Binds to 0.0.0.0 to accept external connections
- Uses Railway's dynamic $PORT environment variable

2. **poetry.lock and pyproject.toml**:
- Must be in sync to avoid deployment issues
- If you see warnings about lock file inconsistency, run:
```bash
cd backend
poetry lock
```

### CORS Configuration

The backend uses FastAPI's built-in CORS middleware with the following configuration:

```python
origins = [
    "https://www.get-toucan.com",
    "https://get-toucan.com",
    "https://toucan.up.railway.app",
    "http://localhost:5173",
]

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### HTTPS Requirements

All production URLs must use HTTPS to avoid mixed content errors. Ensure:

1. **Frontend Environment Variables**:
```bash
# .env.production
VITE_API_URL=https://toucan-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

2. **Railway Configuration**:
- Railway automatically provides HTTPS for all deployments
- Your domain should be configured to use HTTPS
- The `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL` should use HTTPS

## Common Deployment Issues

### 502 Bad Gateway
If you see a 502 Bad Gateway error, check:
1. Procfile exists and has correct configuration
2. poetry.lock is in sync with pyproject.toml
3. All environment variables are set in Railway dashboard

### CORS Errors
If you see CORS errors:
1. Verify your domain is in the `origins` list in `main.py`
2. Check that the backend is actually running (not returning 502)
3. Ensure all CORS middleware settings match the FastAPI docs exactly

### Mixed Content Errors
If you see mixed content errors:
1. Check all API URLs use HTTPS in production
2. Verify environment variables are using HTTPS URLs
3. Update any hardcoded URLs to use HTTPS
4. Clear browser cache after fixing URLs

## Deployment Process

1. **Prepare for Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Ensure poetry.lock is up to date
   cd backend
   poetry lock
   
   # Verify Procfile exists
   cat Procfile
   
   # Check environment variables
   cat .env.production
   ```

2. **Deploy Changes**
   ```bash
   # Commit changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "your commit message"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check health endpoint (note the https)
   curl -v https://toucan-backend-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables in Railway:
- `PORT` (set automatically by Railway)
- `DATABASE_URL` (from Supabase)
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_KEY`
- `ENVIRONMENT` (e.g., "production")

Frontend environment variables:
- `VITE_API_URL` (must use HTTPS in production)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Monitoring

- Railway provides deployment logs in their dashboard
- The `/health` endpoint returns useful diagnostic information:
  - Current environment
  - Timestamp
  - Allowed CORS origins
  - Database connection status
- Monitor browser console for mixed content or CORS errors
